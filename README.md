## Project Description

This project focuses on creating a CNN model for recognizing numeric sign language gestures and then displaying the recognized gestures on an LED 8x8 matrix connected to an Arduino motherboard. The repository contains both the Arduino code for matrix visualization and the Python code for the CNN model.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
